				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<p>The group will:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Develop Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 to address gaps in WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 related to content with a particular focus on users of mobile devices and people with low-vision or with cognitive disabilities. To keep scope focused, candidate Success Criteria will be vetted according to careful <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_2.2_Success_criterion_acceptance_requirements">WCAG 2.2 Success criterion acceptance requirements</a> and follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_2.2_working_process">WCAG 2.2 working process</a>.</li>
					<li>Continue development of a repository of test rules that uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/act-rules-format-1.0/">Accessibility Conformance Testing Framework</a>, to promote a unified interpretation of WCAG 2.x among different web accessibility test tools.</li>
					<li>Develop Silver (provisional name) to succeed WCAG 2.x, using a different framework to allow it to address more disability needs, emerging technologies, and support for the technologies that impact accessibility such as digital content and applications, authoring tools, user agents, assistive technologies, software and web applications, and operating systems.</li>
                    <li>Maintain Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 as needed.</li>
					<li>Continue development of non-normative documents to support implementation of accessibility guidelines.</li>
				</ul>
				<section id="section-out-of-scope">
					<h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
					<p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working group.</p>
					<ul class="out-of-scope">
						<li>The AG WG is not required to be the central repository for accessibility support data.</li>
						<li>The AG WG does not perform conformance evaluations and reviews.</li>
					</ul>

				<section id="success-criteria">
					<h3>Success Criteria</h3>
					<p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
					<p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security, privacy, and internationalization implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
					<p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts. To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.</p>

			<section class="participation">
				<h2 id="participation"> Participation </h2>
				<p> To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 15 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementers of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute four hours per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants. </p>
				<p>Key implementers of WCAG (desktop and non-desktop environments) include Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.), Web authoring tool developers, Web accessibility evaluation tool developers, user agent tool developers, and people with disabilities.</p>
				<p> The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>. </p>
				<p> The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>. </p>
			</section>
			<section id="communication">
				<h2> Communication </h2>
				<p id="public"> Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however. </p>
				<p> Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group home page.</a>
				</p>
				<p> Most Accessibility Guidelines Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis. </p>
				<p> This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:w3c-wai-gl@w3.org">w3c-wai-gl@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-gl/">archive</a>) or on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work. </p>
				<p> The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion. </p>
			</section>
			<section id="decisions"><h2> Decision Policy </h2><p> This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p><p> However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections. </p>The Working Group maintains specific procedures to establish and measure consensus and address objections in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/decision-policy">AG Working Group Decision Policy</a>.<p> This charter is written in accordance with the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires. </p></section>
