			<h2>Applicability</h2>
			<p>The Technique is applicable to any technology that supports the display of additional content on pointer hover or keyboard focus.</p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this failure is to describe a situation where users find it difficult or impossible to dismiss popup content without moving the pointer or the keyboard focus. Content on hover or focus (popup content) appears on top of other page content when hovering over particular elements or keyboard-focusing these elements. For users of screen magnification software, the position of the magnified section of the screen is often centered on their current focus position. Having to move the focus to dismiss popup content automatically moves this section and in turn, the content that the user may want to view after dismissig the popup. This can severely impede the use of content that may be partly or fully covered.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<section class="description"><h2>Example 1</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A popup opens on pointer hover and when the trigger receives keyboard focus it obstructs the visibility of other content on the page. The popup closes automatically when tabbing beyond the trigger or moving the pointer. There is no way to close the popup via the ESC key or some other documented keyboard command.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

			<section class="example">
				<section class="description"><h2>Example 2</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A popup opens on pointer hover and when the trigger receives keyboard focus and obscures other page content. The popup stays open when tabbing to other links, obstructing the visibility of content on the page. There is a close button in the popup but it can only be activated using pointer input and/or tabbing to that button, which changes the focus position. There is no way to close the popup via the ESC key or some other documented keyboard command or by activating the trigger again.</li>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<p>For each area of content that appears due to a hover or focus event check whether:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Activating the trigger dismisses the content.</li>
					<li>The ESC key dismisses the content.</li>
					<li>Any other keyboard shortcut dismisses the content.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If #1, #2, and #3 are false, then content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
				</ul>
