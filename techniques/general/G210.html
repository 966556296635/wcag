			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p>Use this technique on web pages that detect device or user motion such as shaking or tilting and use these motions as a means of input but where the motion itself is not essential to the function of the application.</p>
			<p>This technique does not relate to movement of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events observed by the device other than intentional gesturing by the user. It also does not cover indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology. </p>

		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure people who use mounted devices or who cannot precisely manipulate a device are able to provide inputs through more conventional user interface components.  </p>
			<p>In this technique, when a device sensor such as accelerometers or gyroscope is used to gather input, an additional input mechanism is provided that does not rely on the sensor.</p>

			<h2>Examples</h2>
			<section class="example">
				<h3>Input Fields</h3>
				<p>After text is input in a field, shaking a device shows a dialog offering users to undo the input. Supporting use of the backspace key and/or providing a clear button next to the text field offers the same functionality.</p>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Identify input that relies on motion sensors.</li>
					<li>Check that there is an additional input mechanism that does not rely on a sensor.</li>
					<li>Confirm that the additional input mechanism produces the same results as the sensor</li>
				</ol>

			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Checks #2 and #3 are true.</li>
