			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p class="instructions">All technologies that allow the viewing of content to be restricted to one orientation.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="description">
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to describe how restricting the view and of content to a single orientation is a failure to allow content to be viewed in multiple orientations. When content is presented in this way, users must view the content in the orientation that the author selected. Some users have their devices mounted in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair), and if the content cannot be viewed in that orientation it creates problems for the user.</p>

		<section id="examples">
			<h2>Examples</h2>
		 			<ul>
 				<li>A news app displayed on a device with landscape and portrait display orientations always shows the content in a manner consistent with the portrait orientation. When the device is turned to landscape view, the content appears sideways to the user.</li>
 			    </ul>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the content in landscape view. Check that the content is oriented for this view.</li>
          <li>Open the content in portrait view. Check that the content is oriented for this view.</li>
          <li>If there are any controls that restrict or allow orientation changes, check that the controls can be set to allow checks one and two to be true.</li>
				</ol>
			</section>
			<section class="test-results">
				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If check #1 or check #2 is false and check #3 is false then this failure condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion.</li>
				</ul>
