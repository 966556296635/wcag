			<h2>When to Use</h2>
			<p>Use this technique on web pages that detect device or user motion such as shaking or tilting and use these motions as a means of input but where that motion itself is not essential to the function of the application.</p>
			<p>This technique does not relate to movement of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events observed by the device other than intentional gesturing by the user. It also does not cover indirect motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive technology. </p>

			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>The objective of this technique is to ensure people who may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other motor impairments have the ability to turn off motion actuation to prevent such accidental triggering of functions.</p>
			<p>In this technique, when a device sensor such as accelerometers or gyroscope is used to gather input, a setting is provided to allow the user to turn off the sensor data.</p>

			<h2>Tests</h2>
			<section class="test-procedure">
				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Identify input that relies on motion sensors.</li>
					<li>Check that there is a setting to turn off the motion detection.<li>
					<li>Confirm that changing the setting stops the input from motion detection.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Expected Results</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Checks #2 and #3 are true.</li>
